# Apogee_2k18-project
This repository contains code for the project 
Blind Man Reading Machine created by us (a team of 5)
for our technical fest Apogee

The project when given any hardcopy material in english ultimately gives audio output.

This code takes image of a text and does image processing, converts into a text file using ocr and then gives audio output.
