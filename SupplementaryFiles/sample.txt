Hi I am the blind man reading machine. I can read out text for you. You just have to run the program and i will first capture the image. Then next I will convert the captured image into a grayscale autocontrasted image. Next I will convert the image into a text file using tesseract. Lastly I will read out the text using my bluetooth speaker and pyttsx module. I have been fully programmed in python language. Thank you.
